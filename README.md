## Getting the data

The daily data are updated each day from NOAA, while the monthly data are updated each month around the middle of the month. The data can be found in the [`/data`](data) folder.

## üíª Reproduce the analysis

### Quickstart: use the dev container

This project comes with a ready-to-use [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that includes everything you need to reproduce the analysis (or do a similar one of your own!), including [R](https://r-project.org) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

1. [Launch this project in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=[report_codespaces_id])
2. If you have Docker installed, you can build and run the container locally:
  - Download or clone the project
  - Open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Run the **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container** command

Once the container has launched (it might take a few minutes to set up the first time), you can run the analysis scripts with:
