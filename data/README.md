Masks for various ocean basins. In these files, each variable is an ocean. The variable is 0 for masked-out areas (eg. land or other oceans) or an integer greater than 0 for a region within the ocean. Each ocean is broken up into sub-regions (1, 2, 3, etc.).

Masks are on a 1째 by 1째 grid, which is regridded to 0.25째 by 0.25째 to match the observations.
